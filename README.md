Week 2: Logistic Regression

  Implemented logistic regression for the following scenarios:

    1. Linear decision boundary to predict a student's admission to a university based on performance on 2 tests
    2. Non-linear decision boundary for microchips based on 2 performance metrics

  For both problems, data was first visualized with scatter plots.  A sigmoid function and the logistic cost function 
  were implemented.  Cost function optimization is handled by the octave function "fminunc" to find the minimum of an 
  unconstrained function.  For the non-linear decision boundary the function "mapFeature.m" was written to create 28 
  polynomial features to fit the non-linear decision boundary.
